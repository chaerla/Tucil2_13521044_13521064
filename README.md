## General Information
This program is used to find the closest point pair from the points available using the Divide and Conquer algorithm. First, users will be asked to input the number of points and their dimensions. After that, the coordinates of the points will be randomly generated. Finally, the closest point pair will be shown along with the number of Euclidean formula calculation operations used and execution time (There will a comparison between the Divide and Conquer Algorithm and the Brute Force Algorithm. Also, specifically for 3D points, there will be a point plotter displayed).

## How To Run
In Terminal, run:
```shell
python main.py
```
A splash screen will prompt if the program is run successfully!
